# World scene API

```js
import { defineWorld } from '@diorama/worlds';
export default defineWorld({
  name: 'my-place', title: 'A telling moment',
  description: 'Describe the place and what moves for a nonvisual reader.',
  duration: 8, still: 2,
  bounds: [[-7, -.5, -5], [7, 5, 5]],
  build(W) {
    W.terrain(14, 10); W.grass(14, 10);
    const actor = W.person(0, 0, '#dcb35a', '#34433b', .9);
    return { actor };
  },
  tick({t, parts, W}) {
    parts.actor.rightArm.rotation.x = -.3 - .2 * Math.sin(W.phase(t, 8) * Math.PI * 2);
  }
});
```

Units: x/z form ground plane, y points up. Person faces local +z. Object primitives take centre coordinates; terrain surface is near y=0. People take foot-ground coordinates. Containers default to scene content.

- `group(x=0,y=0,z=0,parent?)` returns a Three.js Group.
- `box(width,height,depth,color,x=0,y=0,z=0,parent?)`.
- `ball(radius,color,x=0,y=0,z=0,parent?)` uses a faceted sphere. Its scale stores radius; put accessories under a separate unscaled group rather than under the ball mesh.
- `cylinder(radius,height,color,x=0,y=0,z=0,parent?,segments=8)`.
- `line([[x,y,z],...],color,radius=.035,parent?)` makes thin cylindrical segments.
- `ring(radius,color,x,y,z,parent?,tube=.028,arc=2π)` lies flat on ground by default; adjust rotation for vertical rings.
- `surface(width,depth,color,x=0,y=.03,z=0,seed=12,variation=.13)` makes a textured matte ground patch with deterministic fine wear, not a new texture per frame.
- `reach(actor,side,targetWorldXYZ)` poses a person’s fixed-length two-link arm toward an endpoint; `side=-1` is left and `+1` right. It returns the actual palm endpoint. Targets outside reach are clamped; compare returned endpoint in contact tests rather than assuming success.
- `terrain(width,depth,color='#718c42',seed=42,{base='none'}={})` adds flat textured ground with a broken coplanar fringe. No soil wall or platform by default. Only use `{base:'slab'}` when a raised display base is explicitly requested.
- `grass(width,depth,count=1400,seed=7)` adds instanced blade fringe, not turf across the centre.
- `tree(x,z,scale=1,seed=3)`; `bench(x,z,rotation=0)`.
- `plant(actor,{crouch=0,lean=0,twist=0})` flexes knees to preserve ground contact while the chest leans/turns independently. Use modest values (crouch .02–.08, lean .05–.16) tied to the task, not generic bobbing. Call it before `reach`.
- `person(x,z,shirt,pants,scale=1,skin?)` returns `root`, `body` (hips), `chest`, `head`, `face`, `leftHand`, `rightHand`, `leftFoot`, `rightFoot`, `leftArm`, `rightArm`, `leftForearm`, `rightForearm`, `leftLeg`, `rightLeg`, `leftShin`, `rightShin`. Limb rotations are about their proximal joint, with local -y at rest. Feet are at ground level; body pivot is above hips.
- `random()` seeded build-time noise, `phase(t,period)` returns [0,1), `smooth(x)` clamped smoothstep.
- `THREE` for custom subject geometry; `own(resource)` registers a disposable geometry, material or texture. Add custom meshes under a W group or `mesh` parent, and set castShadow/receiveShadow deliberately. Opaque primitive meshes get auto-instanced after build; keep references for posing but do not toggle original `.visible` or assign new materials after mounting. Vary transforms instead. Transparency and per-object visibility need a separate, explicitly managed implementation.

Keep `bounds` around the entire motion, including tallest pose. Wider bounds reduce scene fill; do not add arbitrary padding to hide clipping. Camera fitting already adds 12% breathing room.

## Runtime and embedding

`kit/world.js` exports `mountWorld(definition,{el,finish:'miniature'|'pixel'|'halftone'|'blueprint',paused:false})`. It returns `setFinish`, `setPaused`, `setSpeed(0.25..3)`, `seek(seconds)`, `contacts()`, `stats`, `snapshot` and `dispose`, or null on WebGL creation failure. The generated page includes controls and fallback text; a custom integration must expose equivalent pause and finish controls where needed.

To integrate in an existing application: install the pinned Three.js dependency, copy/import `kit/world.js` and import the scene with your bundler's `@diorama/worlds` alias pointing at that module. Mount into a container with explicit height or aspect-ratio. In React, mount inside `useEffect`, dispose in its cleanup. Never import/mount a browser world while rendering on the server. Do not copy the diorama skill's SVG runtime into this world.

Mounts own GPU resources. `dispose()` stops loop, observers and listeners and releases geometry, materials, textures, render target, shadow map and WebGL context. A new mount starts cleanly. Reduced motion renders the declared still. Offscreen and hidden-tab states suspend rendering without advancing the world clock. WebGL context loss stops the loop; context restoration redraws current pose.

Generated HTML is self-contained, not dependency-free: the renderer is bundled in the file. Current examples are around 0.76 MB uncompressed. Parent pages with restrictive CSP must permit their bundled script; prefer a same-origin iframe if that is easier to control. For strict nonce-based CSP, integrate the module in the application's normal build rather than weakening the policy.

For deterministic inspection, add `?inspect&still` to the built URL. Only inspect mode exposes `window.__world.runtime` and the definition. Do not use inspect mode in public marketing embeds.

## Timing and contact inspection
The animation clock uses absolute elapsed wall time, not accumulated clamped frame deltas. Rendering is capped near 30fps, but action speed stays the same after skipped frames. Pause/offscreen/hidden states preserve time; resume starts a new clock anchor. `setSpeed` adjusts playback without changing the authored duration. Use `contactTimes:[seconds,...]` and `contacts({t,parts,W})` returning actual `{label,a:[x,y,z],b:[x,y,z]}` endpoints for automated contact checks.

Built pages accept `?embed` to show only the stage. Their message bridge accepts known finish, paused and playback-rate values only from the same-origin direct parent; `diorama-world` replies report readiness, fallback and runtime state. No wildcard origins or arbitrary execution. Mobile pixel rendering uses a 2 CSS px logical pixel; desktop uses 3 CSS px.

The standard person now has a ~seven-head adult silhouette, tapered torso/limbs and separate hip/chest/head motion. Hand endpoints are at the wrists, with small hand meshes attached. Add aprons/hair/props under the appropriate group rather than rebuilding an inconsistent human. `reach` works in chest coordinates so a leaning torso does not detach arms. Do not scale limbs to reach a prop; move the task, actor or stance.

## Four live finishes
`FINISHES` exports the supported identifiers. Finish switches preserve scene objects, time and pose; only the post-process and render-buffer size change. Miniature/halftone/blueprint use the full stage resolution (DPR capped at 1.5); pixel uses the lower logical grid. Halftone uses deterministic diagonal dots and warm/cool ink selection. Blueprint combines tonal blue with screen-space colour/depth edges and a faint grid. Both new finishes sample the scene depth texture to keep white negative space pristine, including around pale geometry. No extra geometry or GPU resources are allocated per frame or finish switch. All four work through standalone `?finish=...`, the selector and the validated same-origin iframe bridge.
